Finding a great barber is personal.  
Finding one who gets your style and speaks your language? That can be a mission - especially in a city as international as Amsterdam.

That's where BarberScout comes in.

We're building Amsterdam's first dedicated directory of **English-speaking** and **walk-in friendly** barbershops, so you can stop guessing, scrolling, or settling for whatever’s closest. Whether you're new to the city, visiting for a few weeks, or just looking for a fresh fade without the language barrier - we've got you.

### Why We Started BarberScout

After countless awkward haircuts and “lost in translation” appointments, we realized something:  
There’s no central place to find barbers who speak English and deliver sharp, consistent results.

So we decided to build one.

BarberScout is here to:

✅ Help you find reliable, English-speaking barbers in your neighborhood  
✅ Make it easy to see services, prices, and availability — all in one place  
✅ Support local barbers by giving them the visibility they deserve  

### What's Live Now (And What's Coming)

Right now, we’re focused on Amsterdam.  
You’ll find a growing list of English-speaking barbers with verified info and direct links to Book your hair appointment.

Coming soon:

💳 Featured listings for barbers who want to stand out  
💬 Real reviews from the local community  
✈️ Expansion to other major cities across Europe  

### Are You a Barber?

We’d love to feature you — especially if your barbershop:

- Speaks English fluently  
- Offers consistent, high-quality cuts  
- Welcomes walk-ins or same-day appointments

It’s free to get listed, and we’ll do the heavy lifting to get you noticed.
